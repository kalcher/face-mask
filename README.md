## Instructions
1. 3d print the clip. Specifics on resolution or infill shouldn't matter very much (tested with 0.2mm and 20% infill).
2. Fold a piece of tissue or cloth along the long axis to create one long strip.
3. Thread the strip trough the slit of the base clip (yellow) and clip-in the top part (purple).
4. Attach ear straps.
5. Unfold the cloth to form the mask.
